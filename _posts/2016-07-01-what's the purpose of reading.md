读了很多书也忘了很多，那么读书的意义在哪里？

## 读书的意义

> We brush in the morning and throughout the day we accumulate enormous amount of bad stuff in the teeth. Thus, before we start a new day we brush again and get the teeth back to its original cleanliness. We brush our teeth, wash our clothes, apply soap on the body and shampoo on the hair. Because real world is dirty and we don't want to accumulate the dirt.

我们早晨起来刷牙，然后一天下来我们的牙齿里会累积大量的脏东西。因此，第二天的早上我们再一次的刷牙，让牙齿回到最原始干净的状态。我们之所以刷牙，洗衣服，用肥皂洗澡用洗发露洗头，是因为真实世界是污浊的，我们不想累积这些不洁之物。

> What do we do to clean our mind of everyday crap - the rumors, stupidities, fads, reality shows, news and all other dirt we attract from our surrounding world? Periodic exposure to good books washes off the ignorance and gets us back to the state of knowledge. 

那么我们该怎么做来清理大脑的污物——谣言，愚蠢的事，时尚，真人秀，新闻以及其他我们被周围世界所吸引的垃圾？那么我们就需要定期接受好书的洗礼来冲刷走无知和愚昧，让我们从回智慧的状态。

### 如果忘记了该怎么办

> Btw.. if you are losing most of the core content you read in the books you could do to improve reading skills:

顺便提一下，如果你忘记了一本书中大部分核心内容，你可以这样做来提高阅读技巧：

> 1.Look to take notes by keeping a handy journal. It is crazy that even after spending most of my schooling taking notes, I still suck at it. This is one skill most of us could improve.

1.开始记笔记，因为通过记笔记，会让你心中的疑惑豁然开朗，这是我们应该提高的技能之一。

> 2.While/After reading a good book, spend a lot of time thinking about the book. For every hour of reading, spend two hours of thinking & mulling on the ideas. I see too many people impatiently trying to finish a book, instead of spending enough time on digesting it. Start connecting the book's ideas with other ideas you have learnt. Our brain works primarily on connections - try to connect the book's ideas with as much of the existing stuff you have. Better the connections, better is the memory recall.

2.每读完一本好书，都多花点时间去思考一下这本书。每读一小时书，就花两小时思考研究一下这本书的观点以及思想，我发现很多人都是做任务般不耐烦的急于看完一本书，而不能花足够的时间去消化它。开始把你现在看的书中的观点和你以前学习的观点联系起来(译者注：举一反三/触类旁通)。我们的大脑主要做的是联接工作——试图把这本书中的思想和生活中困扰你的东西联系起来。你联接的越好，你记忆的越深(译者注：带着问题去看书也许可以帮助你更好的完成这一点)。

> 3.Doing often strengthens the learning & recall. This is why we were brought a lot of play things while we were in kindergarten. Physical world helps us connect with book's ideas more. For instance, if you visit the locations mentioned in your favorite book, you will remember the book even better for years to come. For non-fiction, often try to implement some of the ideas. For instance, if you are spending too much time reading about business, try spending some time implementing some of the ideas in a pet project.

3.知行合一才能强化你所学的知识。这也是为什么在上幼儿园的时候我们有这么多玩的东西的原因。现实世界帮助我们更好的与书中所学联系到一起。例如，你参观了一本你最喜欢的书中所提到的地方，那么这本书你几年都不会忘记。对于非小说的书，尽可能的去实现书中所提到的思想。比如你看了一本关于商业的书，那么尽可能在一些小项目中去实践书中的观点。

> 4.Try reading similar books. Once you have finished reading a good book, try to find other works that somewhat overlaps. For instance, after reading "War and Peace" you could read something about Napoleon or history of Russia. This helps you create dense networks in your brain instead of shallow ones.

4.试着去读相似的书，当你读完一本书之后，试着去读其他与这本书类似的书。比如，当你读完《战争与和平》，你可以读读关于拿破仑或者俄罗斯历史的书。这会帮助你构筑你的知识框架，而不是浅于表面的碎片知识。
