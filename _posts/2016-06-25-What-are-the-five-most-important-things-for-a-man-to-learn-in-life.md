# 回答

> I will be turning 25 soon.
Five years ago I've made a decision that I will surpass the bad condition I was in back then and that I will work hard to improve myself and my mindset as much as possible.

我即将25岁了。
五年前我下了这样一个决心，我认为我一定可以突破现在的困境，我会努力工作，在生理和心理上，最大限度的提升我自己。

> I believe maturity is a subjective thing and it's based on the emotions and challenges you go through life. I've met 40-year-olds who were acting like 18-year-olds and 18-year-olds who enrolled in the army and at 22 developed such great self-discipline that others can only dream of.

我认为成熟一件很主观的东西，它基于你的情感和你生活中所经历的挑战。我见过一个人虽然40岁了，但看起来像18岁一样年轻，那个人18岁参军，22岁时他的自律能力已经让其他人望尘莫及。

> Based on these thoughts, what you need to focus on the most is internal growth. Don't go adding unnecessary things around you, instead develop inner toughness.

基于这个想法，你最应该关注的是你内心的成长。因此，不要让过多表面的东西来代替它。

> Some of the helpful lesson I learned in my journey towards growth are:

在我的成长旅途中，我学到了如下事情：

## 1.停止抱怨

> Stop complaining. Seriously! It's such a big waste of your daily energy, which is limited by the way. Why use it all up on complaining how much the situation in which you are sucks. Whether you don't like your degree, your city, your job, your boss or any other condition you are in, complaining will do exactly zero in improving your current state. Life doesn't owe you anything and we should never feel entitled to take it for granted. Furthermore if you complain out loud the people around you are going to get sick of it. You are gonna become the guy that bums everyone out and they will start avoiding you. Start doing something about the things that bother you. And if you are afraid of change, embrace it. Change is the only constant we have in this world. Either you lead the change or you get left behind. Follow Tim Ferriss's 21-Day No-Complaint Experiment and you will see that practicing this habit consistently will help you see life differently.

停止抱怨(严肃脸)。抱怨对你的日常生活来说是无意义的。为什么花这么多时间抱怨你的情况有多么糟？无论你多么讨厌你的阶层，你的城市，职业，老板或者其他你所处的情况，抱怨都是无济于事的。生活不欠你什么，我们永远都不要觉得什么事都理所应当。而且，如果你老是大声向周围人抱怨你的痛苦，那么我要告诉你，你正在成为一个大家都不喜欢的人，并且周围人都会开始远离你。着手去解决那些困扰你的事情吧，如果你害怕改变，我只能说，不要怕，拥抱他吧。无论是你主动改变还是被动改变。要知道，在这个世界上，变化是唯一不变的东西。看看*Tim Ferriss*的[21天不抱怨的实验](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2007/09/18/real-mind-control-the-21-day-no-complaint-experiment/)，你会发现，拥有不抱怨这个好习惯，会改变你的一生。

## 2.做一个自信的人

> The girl that is sitting alone at the bar for 20 minutes, she probably wants to talk to you. Even if she hasn't made eye contact with you. She is out alone on a Friday night because she hopes to meet an interesting guy. I feel that today there is a trend among young men that is wrong. In a social media driven world, guys believe that in order to be more successful with women they need to be an overly metro-sexual man who cares more about his looks than his personality. Take care of your grooming but don't obsess about your looks. Go out there, talk to people. Smile and say hello to a cute girl in a supermarket. Start random conversations. No girls fantasize about meeting the dream guy in a club while half drunk. Maybe he just sparks a conversation with her in the metro on a random Wednesday. Be an interesting guy, stop caring about looking manly. Act, develop inner confidence and charisma. It will be scary, but that's the point.

如果一个女生在酒吧独自一人坐着超过了20分钟，她很有可能是想跟你认识，即使你们之前没有眼神交流。在礼拜五的晚上她独自一人，因为她想认识一个有趣的人。我认为如今年轻人的一种趋势的错误的：在社会媒体导向的世界里，很多男士认为，要想获得女生的青睐，必须要极度的有型，这使得他们过多关注外表而不是个性或者说品质。你应该关注你的衣装是否整洁得体，但是不要因为你的外表而烦恼。大胆的出去结交更多朋友，无论聊什么。在超市向一个可爱的女生微笑并且问好，开始随意的交谈。没有女生想在酒吧半醉的情况下遇到一个满嘴梦想的人（我的理解是，不要老是向别人谈论你的梦想？不知道对不对），也许你跟一个女生只是在一个随便不知道什么日子的某个星期三，在一节地铁里相遇，你们便可以简单的对话。做一个充满乐趣的人吧，不要过度的关注自己看上去是不是足够man，取而代之的是行为，内心是否足够的自信和足够魅力。这件事也许听起来很恐怖，但很关键。

## 3.勇敢面对困境

> It teaches you discipline. I had moments when I set goals for myself but always failed in being consistent because I didn't see the results. Then when I started running marathons and later doing power-lifting I learned that I will not see results very soon. You have to fall in love with the process itself and detach from the outcome. I used to say that people who practice sports are just mindless pieces of muscle, but once you start practicing psychical activities you learn how much hard work is behind it and you gain so much respect for people who are active. They are actually some of the smartest people I know.

它教给你的是规则。有时候当我给自己设定目标的时候我会因为不能坚持而以失败而告终，究其原因是由于我看不到结果。我先跑马拉松，跑完之后再做力量训练，我知道我将很久才能看到结果。你必须热爱过程而不是结果，我以前常说那些热爱运动的人只是很蠢的增加肌肉而已，但是当你亲身去实践它时你会发现健身的背后到底有多难么，并且你如果你进行下去，你会获得那些热爱运动的人的尊敬，他们真的很厉害！

> It becomes a point of reference. Every time I was going through hard times, I would practice mental strength the same way I would practice psychical strength. Muscles grow by basically hurting them. See every challenge as an opportunity to grow and learn no matter how difficult it is. You are not what happens to you but you are how you react to it.

这是一个参考点，每当我经历一个艰难时刻的时候，我都告诉自己，只要我挺过去，我的脑力和心理能力都将得到提升。肌肉增长的原理来自己伤害它们。把每一次的挑战都当成提示自我的机会，而不要去纠结它到底有多难。**You are not what happens to you but you are how you react to it**(这句读起来很舒服，不翻了，任性)。

> Endorphins. The natural way of relieving stress and surviving days when you feel a bit under the weather.

内啡肽，当你感到不舒服时，它会自然的帮你缓解压力。

## 4.思考 

> Sounds obvious, right? You would be surprised how many people don't practice this actively. Most people tend to react more to their surroundings. They get lost in the nitty-gritty and don't actual control what they should focus on. A lot of people will tell you that in your 20's you need to do everything. Experiment with this and that. In a ADD (attention deficit disorder) dominated world where we are hit constantly with notifications and impulses everywhere, this can lead you in a spiral that amounts to nothing in the end. I suggest putting value on THINKING first, then DOING. The people that tell you to do stuff are the people that want to take advantage of your skills, so they can do the thinking instead and you can do the work for them. 400.000 years ago none of this existed. It was created by someone's mind gradually. Practice writing 10 ideas per day and go for long walks in the park every Sunday. Become present. Grab control. Take perspective on it all.

是不是听起来很显而易见？你会因为为什么很多人不积极的锻炼思考能力而感到惊讶。大多数人倾向于过多的对周围表象的事物做出反应，他们迷失在了事物的表象而不能真正抓住本质。大多数人告诉你在你二十岁的年纪你应该做这做那做各种各样的事。在一个缺乏专注力的世界里，我们不断的收到各种通知使得我们的心理受到来自各种地方的冲击，这会让你陷入漩涡并且最终什么也得不到。我建议先思考而后行动。那些一直让你做各种事情的人，他们是想让锻炼你做事的技能，取而代之的是由自己来思考，然后让你为他们工作。这些在四十万年以前是不存在的，他们是之后慢慢的被某些人创造出来的。每天练习在纸上写下你十个想法，在每个周日独自去公园散步思考。活在当下，获得控制权，掌握大局观。

## 5. 管理你的输入和输出

> I used to hate reading. I think I only read one proper book by the time I turned 20. During school I would always read the online short versions or watch the movies of the books. The books in the program just didn't click with me. Then after finishing school I still had a huge thirst for knowledge so I started researching topics that I liked and read the most recommended books. And this is how I fell in love with reading and it's something I strive to do daily for at least one hour. Now I always carry my small Kindle with me. Every time I have 10 minutes I take it out and read another page. At this point I've lost count at around 200 books and my only worry is that I don't have enough time to read everything. But there's a catch. Reading is input. In order to actually grow as an individual you also have to create a set of actions as output. Don't just read and feel excited that you are becoming so smart. For that you need to put in practice what you read: share your "aha" moment from the book with a friend, write a review, start a project. Don't move on to the next read until you put in practice one lesson from your current one.

我以前是一个讨厌读书的人。我记得在我二十岁的时候我只读过一本合适的书。在上学期间我总是读网上的短文或者看书的电影版。在当时我的世界里没有书这个东西。当我结束学校生活时，我依旧有很大的求知欲，于是我开始研究我喜欢的课题然后读相关推荐的书籍。这就是我爱上读书的原因，我每天坚持至少阅读一小时，现在我每天带着我的小kindle，每当我有十分钟时，我都会把kindle拿出来读一读。我大概读了有两百本书吧，我唯一担心的就是想读的书太多没时间去读他们。但这里有一个问题，读书是输入，为了真实的成长你还需要输出。不要局限于阅读然后想你是多么聪明，你需要将你的东西进行有效的输出：向你的朋友分享你的心得，写一个总结或者开始一个小项目，在你将输入的知识输出之前，不要再输入另外一个知识。

给大家送上我最喜欢的四个字：

***知行合一***

**祝所有在二十岁左右的同学，都能成为更好的自己**
