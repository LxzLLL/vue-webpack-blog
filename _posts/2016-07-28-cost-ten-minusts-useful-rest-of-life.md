# 什么东西只花十分钟，但是受益终身

> Our education system focuses on rote learning and remembering. In the era of internet and search engines, we need to re-look at the order of learning and acquiring knowledge. The new paradigm should be to "Learn to Learn"

我们的教育系统致力于机器学习与记忆。在互联网与搜索引擎的时代，我们需要重新看看学习和获取知识的目的，我称之为“学习如何学习”。
 
 > The Illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write but those who cannot Learn, Unlearn and Relearn - Alvin Toffler.

**在21世纪，文盲不是指那些不会看书写字的人，而是指不会学习，以及二次学习的人——Alvin Toffler**。

> Since, most of the information is readily available, the primary focus has to be to learn, unlearn and relearn.

因为大部分的信息都是可以读到的(除非国家机密这些)，所以我们主要关注的是如何学习以及二次学习。

## 阅读技能：SQ3R法

> If you're looking to be a more efficient reader, try the SQ3R Method. It's designed to help you read faster and retain more. SQ3R stands for the steps in reading: Survey, Question, Read, Recite & Review.

如果你想成为一个更高效的阅读者，可以试试`SQ3R`法。它可以帮助你在较短的时间记住较长的知识。`SQ3R`表示： Survey, Question, Read, Recite & Review.（调查，提问，阅读，叙述，温故）

### Survey

> Before reading, survey the material. Glance through the topic headings and try to get an overview of the reading. Skim the sections and read the final summary paragraph to get an idea of where the chapter is going. Only spend a few minutes surveying the reading to get a background knowledge, an initial orientation that will help you to organize the material as you read it. It eases you into the reading assignment

在阅读之前，先调查好材料。快速浏览一下目录，对这本书有个大概的了解。然后浏览一下每个目录章节的摘要，对这本书的的来龙去脉有个概念。花几分钟来对整本书有个简单的背景知识，这会帮助你让你在一开始有一个好的阅读方向。

### Question

> Look at the first heading in the chapter. Turn it into a question. Ask questions to be answered in your reading. This step requires conscious effort, but is worth it as it leads to active reading, the best way to retain written material. Asking questions focuses your concentration on what you need to learn or get out of your reading.

先看一下章节的第一个标题，然后针对这个标题提出一个问题，这一步需要你主观意识上去做，它可以主导你的阅读，这是保持记忆最好的方法。因为在你回答问题的时候，需要你集中注意去思考你需要学什么，需要思考什么。

### Read

> Read the first section of your reading assignment to answer your question. Actively search for the answer to your question. If you finish the section and haven't answered the question, reread it. Read reflectively. Consider what the author is trying to say, and think about how you can use that information.

阅读你这个章节的第一部分，一边读一边主动的去寻找答案，如果这一章节读下来你一点头绪都没有，再读。去理解作者在这里想说的是什么，然后你该如何利用他说的这些东西。

### Recite


> Once you've read an initial section, look away and try to recite the answer to your question, using your own words and examples. If you can do this, it means that you understand the material. If you can't, glance over the section again. Once you have the answers to your questions, write them down.

当你第一次阅读完这一章节，试着用自己的话去回答你当初的问题。如果你能做到，证明你已经理解这一章节了。如果不行，再简单的浏览一下这个章节。一旦你能回答了，把答案写下来。

### Review

> After reading the entire assignment, test your memory by asking yourself the questions that you've identified. Review your notes for an overview the chapter. Consider how it fits with what you know from the course, experience, and other classes. What is the material's significance? What are the implications or applications of this material? What questions are you left with?

在你完成整个阅读后，问自己几个你当初提过的问题，温故一下你的笔记对这个章节有一个理解。思考一下这些知识如何实际运用，这本书的意义是什么？你对它所说的这些还有什么疑问吗？

> How many of the steps you follow is up to you. As you become more efficient you may find that you can read more - and retain more - wit h less effort. Regardless, if an assignment is important, be sure to take notes so that you don't have to reread it later.

这些你想执行多少次看你自己。在你不停的学习实践过程中你会发现，你可以读的更过，记忆的更久，但是花的努力更少。无论一个阅读任务重不重要，都要记笔记，这样你就不需要再次去读原书了。
