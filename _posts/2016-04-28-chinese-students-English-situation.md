# Why are some Chinese students who have learnt English for years still poor in English?

## answer

>The teaching method for English in China is poor. The main reason for this is because the examination method is poor. Teachers teach for the exam and nothing else. The exam is based on vocabulary memorization and understanding of grammar rules. There is no need to compose sentences let alone paragraphs or longer essays. There is no need to speak, and there is no need to understand when listening, because none of those things are in the examinations of middle or high school.

因为中国的英语教学方法是比较弱的。主要原因是考试方法比较弱。老师(我们起爷可不是这样)只交如何应对考试，不交别的。而考试主要依靠学生词汇的记忆以及对语法规则的掌握——它不需要你去写句子，更不要说短文了；也不需要你去“说”和“听”，因为这些在中学或高中里是不考的（我觉得也考啊，译者表示不服）。

>I teach at a university in China. Every student must have passed the English test in the University Entrance Exam (Gaokao) at the end of high school. They must also pass the CET4 or CET6 (College English Test) which contains a very short writing task but mainly covers listening, reading and translation to a high level of proficiency and a high vocabulary. However if I go and talk to any of them, they can't understand me and they can't reply or ask me anything. Every student knows English, but few students can use English.

我在中国大学教书。在中国的每一个学生就读高中时，必须通过高考才能考取理想的大学，而在大学也必须要通过CET4、CET6(大学英语测试)，这个测试只包含非常短的写作练习，主要考察的是高难度的听，读，翻译能力以及词汇量。然而如果我去跟他们这些通过测试的学生聊天，他们听不懂我在说什么，更别提跟我对话或者问我问题了。每个人都懂英语，但是不会用。

>None of the exams require writing composition or speaking (other than English majors). They know what a large number of words mean in Chinese but they don't know how to pronounce them or used them within a sentence.


没有一个考试考察学生的写作或者口语能力(除了英语专业的)。他们知道许多单词，但是不知道发音或者如何用他们组成句子。

>It then becomes cyclical as teachers who can't speak English but know the vocabulary then teach the next generation of students.


这样培育出来的学生(只会词汇不会读)成为老师，再教下一批学生，如此反复，会形成一个恶心循环。

>A few students do break out of the cycle. Typically their parents paid for private English classes after school. Often this will have included classes with a native English speaker, which would solve many problems. I still find that their writing is lacking. Even when they can speak fluently, they can't write in a structured way. 

很少有学生可以打破这个循环。通常是他们的父母花钱，让他们在课外上私人英语培训课。通常这个培训课有一个以英语为母语的老师，他们可以解决许多中国学生学英语的问题。我还发现他们的写作是很渣的。即使他们可以很流利的对话了，但是他们的写作依然很弱。

>They will never learn to write properly until they decide to move abroad and have to do the IELTS or TOEFL exams. Here for the fist time they meet an exam that requires the full range of skills, reading, listening, writing and speaking. Even after studying English in primary, middle, high school, university and private classes after school for some 14 years or more, they still need extra classes on writing and speaking composition. Why? Because it had never, until now, been in any exam and so they have never, until now, had a teacher who bothered to teach it to them.


他们从来不学如何用英语写作，除非他们要出国了，不得不通过雅思或者托福的考试，才会开始学。雅思或者托福考试，是他们遇到的第一个，全面考察学生英语能力的考试，包括听说读写。即使是一个从小学到中学，高中，大学以及在课外还参加私人英语培训的人(花在英语上的时间超过了14年)，他们仍然需要额外的课程来训练他们的写作以及口语能力，才能应对这个考试。为什么会这样？因为他们之前从没有一场考试有这样的要求，从没有一个老师如此费心的教他们这些。

>In contrast, when I was learning French in the UK, the teachers focus was on giving us a usable, working understanding of the language. Speaking was given importance right form the start and grammar only considered after a modest vocabulary had been built and could be used. Exam requirements were ignored until just a month or two before the test date.

与之相反，当我在英国学法语的时候，老师教的是法语中“用”——读是一开始最重要的，而语法只需建立在掌握了适量的词汇，并且会用这些词汇之后。不到考试前一两个月，我们根本不用关心考试考的是什么。
